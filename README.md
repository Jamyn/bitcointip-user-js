# [Bitcointip](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip) user script

This is a Greasemonkey user script that adds a "tip bitcoins" button
next to reddit's "give gold". It also displays
[bitcointip's](http://www.reddit.com/u/bitcointip/) verifications more
concisely. Here's what it looks like.

It's verified to work in both Firefox with Greasemonkey and Chrome
with Tampermonkey. It should work in other browsers that support user
scripts, as long as they support `unsafeWindow`.
